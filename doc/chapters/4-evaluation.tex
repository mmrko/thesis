\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{chapter:evaluation}

% Tässä osassa esitetään tulokset ja vastataan tutkielman alussa
% esitettyihin tutkimuskysymyksiin. Tieteellisen kirjoitelman
% arvo mitataan tässä osassa esitettyjen tulosten perusteella.

% You have done your work, but that’s1 not enough.
% You also need to evaluate how well your implementation works. The
% nature of the evaluation depends on your problem, your method, and your
% implementation that are all described in the thesis before this chapter. If
% you have created a program for exact-text matching, then you measure how
% long it takes for your implementation to search for different patterns, and
% compare it against the implementation that was used before. If you have
% designed a process for managing software projects, you perhaps interview
% people working with a waterfall-style management process, have them adapt
% your management process, and interview them again after they have worked
% with your process for some time. See what’s changed.
% The important thing is that you can evaluate your success somehow.
% Remember that you do not have to succeed in making something spectacular;
% a total implementation failure may still give grounds for a very good master’s
% thesis—if you can analyze what went wrong and what should have been done.
