\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chapter:conclusions}

\sout{Actual challenges:
- (integrated) normalized light source
- luminophors
- usability (time constraints \& ambient light)
- differences between cameras/vendor APIs
- Poor API support, no fine grained control over the camera (ISO, shutter speed)
As mobile camera technology and the surrounding APIs mature,
Future work (isot kokonaisuudet!)
  - faster (custom) luminophors?
  - light source optimization
  - kuva vs. video?
Go for NFC
- standard, reader built-in to most modern smartphones
- more flexible
- painpont: visible to the bare eye, unit cost of (secure, durable) tags?
- RQ3: security considered not so much
NFC is today's technology for smartphone based production authentication.}
