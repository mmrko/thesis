\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chapter:discussion}
kuva vs. video

- structural similarity
- clipping (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCbCr)
- idempotence of the luminphores (photobleach)
- analogies to existing solutions (InkSure \& CryptoGlyph)
- security: get hold of the device or man-in-the-middle (metadata works as a layer of indirection)
- decay time Android 200-250ms because of led flash vs. WP's Xenon flash
phosphorescence vs. fluorescence (infeasible coz time)
- high res images could be used as camera APIs improve
- peak method performs poorly against the histogram approach for single coloured luminophors
- more novel selection criterion

TODO:

color calibration (requires use of RAW data)
device detection (automatic configuration)
iOS support (ios with c++? On iOS this extra bridge is unnecessary as C++ code can directly invoke Objective-C APIs.)
- binary thresholding (naive but simple and fits the context)
- Algorithmic Robustness
- Performance Analysis
- Problem Space and Challenges

% At this point, you will have some insightful thoughts on your implementation

% Unfortunately most cameras—even of the same type—
% do not exhibit consistent responses. Figure 1 illustrates the
% differences between the responses of 8 cameras to the 24
% colors of the GretagMacbeth [5] ColorCheckerTM chart
% imaged under the same illumination conditions and using
% the same hardware settings. The data shows that color
% values are significantly different from camera to camera.
% This is due for example to aperture variations, fabrication
% variations, electrical noise, and interpolation artifacts arising
% from the reconstruction of a full-resolution color image
% from a half-resolution Bayer pattern image

The preview feed was used since the Android and Windows Phone versions (Kitkat and 8.1, respectively) lacked the proper support for burst mode (image capture at a predefined interval). Furthermore, frames could not be captured individually as Thus, there was no way to schedule the capture to take place at a specific interval.

- alternative approach: colored dots form a discrete pattern, no grating necessary
- camera parameter configuration to ensure scalability

- a fast background-independent retrieval strategy for color image databases
- definitely feasible using sophisticated algorithms. Actual challenges: (integrated) normalized light source, luminophors
- more efficient matching if done server-side (leverage histogram data directly?)
No offical API, no fine grained control over the camera (ISO, shutter speed)
JavaCPP, Xamarin
Developer convenience
Future work (isot kokonaisuudet!)
NFC
- availability of NFC-enabled smartphones (minor)
- unit cost of tags

Color calibration

There are mainly two modules responsible for the color-rendering accuracy of a digital camera: the former is the illuminant estimation and correction module, and the latter is the color matrix transformation aimed to adapt the color response of the sensor to a standard color space. These two modules together form what may be called the color correction pipeline.

RGB is a device-dependent color model: different devices detect or reproduce a given RGB value differently, since the color elements (such as phosphors or dyes) and their response to the individual R, G, and B levels vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, or even in the same device over time. Thus an RGB value does not define the same color across devices without some kind of color management.
