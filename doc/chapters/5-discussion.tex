an\_400\_r/13SVa vs. an\_400\_r/13SVb

Matches against xxx\_r vs the b sample points to the fact that the taggant creation process plays a big role...
wp\_600/13VPb: matches everything with fingerprint method, only a few with histogram (=> anomaly)
Increase of margin from 10\% to 15\% had minimal impact for both approaches

Fingerprint method: harsh misses (histogram method more stable)

Afterglow brightness is also proportional to the intensity of UV contained in the excitation light.

The development of LumiNova resulted from the demands placed upon Nemoto  Co. Ltd.,  by the Japanese watch and clock manufacturers which did not want to use radioactive luminous dials in their products

Focus distance and torch were adjusted as per the platform: S4 does not support setting focus to a fixed minimum distance, and thus, macro focusing was used to guarantee the camera would be able to focus on the taggant. However this

The preview feed was used since the Android and Windows Phone versions (Kitkat and 8.1, respectively) lacked the proper support for burst mode (image capture at a predefined interval). Furthermore, frames could not be captured individually as Thus, there was no way to schedule the capture to take place at a specific interval.

- alternative approach: colored dots form a discrete pattern, no grating necessary
- camera parameter configuration to ensure scalability

- a fast background-independent retrieval strategy for color image databases
- definitely feasible using sophisticated algorithms. Actual challenges: (integrated) normalized light source, luminophors
- more efficient matching if done server-side (leverage histogram data directly?)
No offical API, no fine grained control over the camera (ISO, shutter speed)

Color calibration

There are mainly two modules responsible for the color-rendering accuracy of a digital camera: the former is the illuminant estimation and correction module, and the latter is the color matrix transformation aimed to adapt the color response of the sensor to a standard color space. These two modules together form what may be called the color correction pipeline.

RGB is a device-dependent color model: different devices detect or reproduce a given RGB value differently, since the color elements (such as phosphors or dyes) and their response to the individual R, G, and B levels vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, or even in the same device over time. Thus an RGB value does not define the same color across devices without some kind of color management.
