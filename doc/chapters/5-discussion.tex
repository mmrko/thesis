\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chapter:discussion}

Parameters:
CAPTURE PARAMS ... discuss!! (why macro, why fixed...)
- decay time Android 200-250ms because of led flash vs. WP's Xenon flash
- Daylight WB because Yongnuo YN565EX (5600K temp) \& least compensation
- Focus distance and torch were adjusted as per the platform: S4 does not support setting focus to a fixed minimum distance, and thus, macro focusing was used to guarantee the camera would be able to focus on the taggant. However this
- The preview feed was used since the Android and Windows Phone versions (Kitkat and 8.1, respectively) lacked the proper support for burst mode (image capture at a predefined interval). Furthermore, frames could not be captured individually as Thus, there was no way to schedule the capture to take place at a specific interval.
- Poor API support, no fine grained control over the camera (ISO, shutter speed)
- values of analysis and matching param values?
- normalized light source required, cant use builtin doesnt excite

Findings:
- which taggants perform the best, and why?
- SP <-> O (similar)
- an\_400\_r/13SVa vs. an\_400\_r/13SVb
- good match: an\_600/24SPa, an\_600\_r/24VPb
- wp\_600/13VPb: matches everything with fingerprint method, only a few with histogram (=> anomaly)
- Matches against xxx\_r vs the b sample points to the fact that the taggant creation process plays a big role...
- Margin increase => minimal impact for both approaches
- Fingerprint method: more misses (histogram method more stable)
- peak method performs poorly against the histogram approach for single coloured luminophors
- \ref{equation:fingerprint-penalty} - shortcoming of the fingerprint method?

Technology:
- Eventual consistency (CouchDB) (http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/consistency.html, http://pouchdb.com/guides/replication.html)
- Schema flexibility (NoSQL) SYNC!

Luminofori:
- phosphorescence vs. fluorescence (infeasible coz time)
- Afterglow brightness is also proportional to the intensity of UV contained in the excitation light.
- The development of LumiNova resulted from the demands placed upon Nemoto  Co. Ltd.,  by the Japanese watch and clock manufacturers which did not want to use radioactive luminous dials in their products
- Erilaisilla hiloilla, suodattimilla, raoilla ja peileilla on ehdottoman tarkea tehtavansa riittavan resoluution aikaansaamiseksi ja jotta saadaan valituksi tarkka viritysaallonpituus ja saadaan minimoiduksi sironta ja taustaluminesenssi. aikaerotteisen maarityksen etuna on se, etta viritysvalo ehtii sammua kokonaan ja sirontailmioiden aiheuttaman taustan vaikutus poistuu. Pitka elinika mahdollistaa myos edullisen ja varsin yksinkertaisen laitteiston kayton.122,124

Color calibration

There are mainly two modules responsible for the color-rendering accuracy of a digital camera: the former is the illuminant estimation and correction module, and the latter is the color matrix transformation aimed to adapt the color response of the sensor to a standard color space. These two modules together form what may be called the color correction pipeline.

RGB is a device-dependent color model: different devices detect or reproduce a given RGB value differently, since the color elements (such as phosphors or dyes) and their response to the individual R, G, and B levels vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, or even in the same device over time. Thus an RGB value does not define the same color across devices without some kind of color management.

% Unfortunately most cameras—even of the same typedo not exhibit consistent responses. Figure 1 illustrates the
% differences between the responses of 8 cameras to the 24 colors of the GretagMacbeth [5] ColorCheckerTM chart
% imaged under the same illumination conditions and using the same hardware settings. The data shows that color
% values are significantly different from camera to camera. This is due for example to aperture variations, fabrication
% variations, electrical noise, and interpolation artifacts arising from the reconstruction of a full-resolution color image
% from a half-resolution Bayer pattern image

- thus it be better to add some structural \& spatial similarity semantics (- more novel selection criterion) - analogies to existing solutions (InkSure \& CryptoGlyph)
  - alternative approach: colored dots form a discrete pattern, no grating necessary
- high res images could be used as camera APIs improve
- YCbCr suffers from clipping (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCbCr)
- binary thresholding (naive but simple and fits the context)
- color calibration (requires use of RAW data)
  - CCD > CMOS koska parempi herkkyys
- device detection (automatic configuration, database per phone model)
- iOS support (ios with c++? On iOS this extra bridge is unnecessary as C++ code can directly invoke Objective-C APIs.)
- more efficient matching if done server-side (leverage histogram data directly?)
  - easy to switch over because the offline-first approach taken
- change management / how to handle updates \& different devices?


Security
- get hold of the device or man-in-the-middle (metadata works as a layer of indirection)
using a predefined username and password (easily extendable to a real user auth)
- CouchDB uses a traditional cookie based authentication scheme, and as such, applications can be vulnerable to CSRF attacks. However, the application has no CSRF attacks vectors as it the DBMS and the application server is read-only
Traditional Cookie-Based Auth (could be extended to Modern Token-Based Auth such as JWT)
